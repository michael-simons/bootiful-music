To build the modules of this project, you have to have PostgreSQL database with some defined schemas up and running.
There's a Docker module and a Docker Compose file to help you with that:
Please run `(cd docker && docker-compose up)&` from the root of this project.
To stop the processes, use  `(cd docker && docker-compose stop)`.
