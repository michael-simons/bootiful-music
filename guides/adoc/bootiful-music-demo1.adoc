= My „business“ domain

== Cypher (1): Simple CRUD

"Give me all the artists" reads as this:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (a:Artist) RETURN a
----

That is pretty boring, as there are is no data yet. Let's create some.

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
CREATE (b:Artist:Band {name: 'Queen'})
RETURN b
----

This creates a node with two labels (`Artist` and `Band` and one property, name).

== Cypher (2): Not so simple CRUD

Bands used to release albums

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (b:Band {name: 'Queen'})
CREATE (a:Album {name: 'A Night At The Opera'}) - [r:RELEASED_BY] -> (b)
RETURN a, r, b
----

This statements works, but has a problem: If run twice, it creates the same album again.
Luckily, we can create constraints:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (a:Album) ASSERT a.name IS UNIQUE
----

And there is the `merge` clause: The `merge` clause matches existing nodes and relationships, creating a pattern if there's no match:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (b:Band {name: 'Queen'})
MERGE (a:Album {name: 'A Day At The Races'}) - [r:RELEASED_BY] -> (b)
RETURN a, r, b
----

== Cypher (3): Not so simple CRUD

Albums usually have a release year.
A year is part of a decade.

Here we use multiple merges in one go.
The reason being: `merge` creates the full complete pattern

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MERGE (decade:Decade {value: 1970})
MERGE (year:Year {value: 1976})
MERGE (year) - [:PART_OF] -> (decade)
MERGE (artist:Artist {name: 'Queen'})
MERGE (album:Album {name: 'A Day At The Races'}) - [:RELEASED_BY] -> (artist)
MERGE (album) - [:RELEASED_IN] -> (year)
RETURN *
----

A SQL query yielding the same result would consist of a select and at least 2, probably more inserts, depending on the normalization.

== A look at the scheme so far

While Neo4j is fully ACID-compliant, there is no real scheme. Nodes, properties and relationships are create as needed.
We can however retrieve the current scheme

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
call db.schema()
----

This is a stored procedure.
There are a lot of built-ins, you can add APOC and Graph algorithms and also your own.

== Not quite there yet: Adding genres

I want to have some more information. The genres of albums:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MATCH (a:Album)
WHERE a.name in ['A Night At The Opera', 'A Day At The Races']
WITH a
MERGE (g:Genre {name: 'Rock'})
MERGE (a) - [:HAS] -> (g)
RETURN a,g
----

== Not quite there yet: Adding members

And origin of Bands and their members:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
MERGE (gb:Country {code: 'GB', name: 'Great Britain'})
MERGE (tz:Country {code: 'TZ', name: 'Tanzania'})
WITH gb, tz
MATCH (b:Band {name: 'Queen'})
MERGE (b) - [:FOUNDED_IN] -> (gb)
MERGE (fm:Artist:SoloArtist {name: 'Freddie Mercury'}) 
MERGE (fm) - [:BORN_IN] -> (tz)
MERGE (b) - [:HAS_MEMBER {joinedIn: 1970, leftIn: 1991}] -> (fm)
RETURN *
----

== The resulting scheme

Now things look like this:

[source,cypher,subs=attributes]
----
call db.schema() yield nodes, relationships
return filter(node in nodes where any(label IN apoc.node.labels(node) WHERE NOT label  in ["WikipediaArticle", "Artist"])) as nodes, relationships
----
